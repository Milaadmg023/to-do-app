# ToDo App

A simple program for recording and accomplishing daily tasks. A straightforward design and merely a project for practice :). The first experience working with TypeScript was enjoyable.

## Technologies Used

- Next Js
- Tailwind Css
- TypeScript

## Getting Started
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Milaadmg023/ts-to-do-app.git)https://github.com/Milaadmg023/ts-to-do-app.git
cd ts-to-do-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
